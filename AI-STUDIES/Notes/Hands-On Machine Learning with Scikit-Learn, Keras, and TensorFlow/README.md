# ðŸ“’ Notes: *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*

This directory contains notes organized by chapter from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*. Each file reflects my understanding of key concepts, along with code examples and essential insights to deepen learning in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

The notes are arranged by chapter, enabling quick and easy access to specific topics from the book. The file structure is as follows:

```
Notes/
â””â”€â”€ Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter_01
        â”œâ”€â”€ Note.md
        â””â”€â”€ Note.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter_02
        â”œâ”€â”€ Note.md
        â””â”€â”€ Note.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ Chapter_N
```

Each `Note.md` file covers a specific topic taught in the corresponding chapter, while an accompanying `Note.py` file may be included to showcase algorithms that exemplify the discussed concepts. Both files feature practical examples and application notes.
